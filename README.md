# gdx-spriter
gdx-spriter is a library letting you render your Spriter animations at runtime in the LibGDX game engine. Originally forked from https://github.com/Trixt0r/spriter, gdx-spriter has a different goal than its original fork.

## Spriter

Spriter is a partially free (some features requires a premium licence) 2D animator compatible with many game engines. I do not work for Spriter but I've been using it personnally.
